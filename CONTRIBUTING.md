## Development

[cloud]’s website runs on [Vapid](https://vapid.com), an intentionally simple content management system which is easy to learn and to use. All you need to know are the fundamentals of HTML and SCSS.

The common steps for making changes to the website are the following:

1. Before you start working on something, [submit an issue](https://gitlab.dessau.design/cloud/cloud-dessau-org/-/boards) on the Issue Board first to discuss your idea.
2. [Fork](https://gitlab.dessau.design/cloud/cloud-dessau-org/-/forks/new) the repository (this creates a copy on your personal account that you can work on)
3. Add a new branch for the feature or fix you want to work on
4. Make changes and test them on your machine or on a development server
5. Once everything works, create a [merge request](https://gitlab.dessau.design/cloud/cloud-dessau-org/-/merge_requests) so the changes can be reviewed and approved
